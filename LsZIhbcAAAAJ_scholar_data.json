        "abstract": "Developers have long used game engines for visualizing virtual worlds for players to explore. However, using real-world data in a game engine is always a challenging task, since most game engines have very little support for geospatial data. This paper presents our findings from exploring the Unity3D game engine for visualizing large-scale topographic data from mixed sources of terrestrial laser scanner models and topographic map data. Level of detail (LOD) 3 3D models of two buildings of the Universitas Gadjah Mada campus were obtained using a terrestrial laser scanner converted into the FBX format. Mapbox for Unity was used to provide georeferencing support for the 3D model. Unity3D also used road and place name layers via Mapbox for Unity based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. LOD1 buildings were modeled from topographic map data using Mapbox, and 3D models from the terrestrial laser scanner replaced two of these buildings. Building information and attributes, as well as visual appearances, were added to 3D features. The Unity3D game engine provides a rich set of libraries and assets for user interactions, and custom C# scripts were used to provide a bird’s-eye-view mode of 3D zoom, pan, and orbital display. In addition to basic 3D navigation tools, a first-person view of the scene was utilized to enable users to gain a walk-through experience while virtually inspecting the objects on the ground. For a fly-through experience, a drone view was offered to help users inspect objects from the air. The result was a multiplatform 3D visualization capable of displaying 3D models in LOD3, as well as providing user interfaces for …",

The large amount of geotagged data coined the term `Geospatial Big Data', indicating the semi-structured and unstructured nature of such data. SQL relational databases have been known in the past to handle geospatial data very well. However, the abundance of geospatial big data pushed forward the need for NoSQL database which is expected to perform better in terms of handling and storing geospatial big data. This paper discusses the quantitative comparison of performance between the SQL (i.e., PostGIS) and NoSQL (i.e., MongoDB) databases in handling geospatial big data.

Consequently, 3D cadastral surveys are increasingly being employed for strata unit ownership registration as a part of land administration services. At present, most national land information systems do not support 2D and 3D cadastral visualizations. A field survey or validation survey is required to determine the geometry of 3D spatial units for property registration. However, the results of 3D surveys and mapping are not stored in the land information system. This work aims to integrate 2D and 3D geospatial data of property units collected from cadastral surveys with their corresponding legal data. It reviews the workflow for the use of 3D survey data for first-titling of 3D properties in Indonesia. A scenario of use and a prototype were developed based on existing practices and the possibility of extending Indonesia’s Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) to represent 3D units. Data submitted to the prototype as 3D geometries was survey data from 3D cadastral surveys or validation surveys utilizing terrestrial survey methods. The prototype used PostGIS and Cesium Ion to store 3D geometries of data from six 3D surveys. Registrars in local land offices could use the prototype to undertake strata unit registration that establishes a relationship among geospatial features and their survey documents and legal documents. Cesium JS was used as a 3D browser, customized as a web application, to manage and visualize 3D survey data to support strata title registration.

This is evidenced by the abundance of seabed rising, and there is a dead sea lake area that has a higher salinity than the sea. Biodiversity on Rote Island has endemic and unique flora and fauna. This study aims to create an integrated system of inland waters resources on Rote Island with a multidisciplinary approach. Inland water resources on Rote Island number more than 80 lakes and ponds. An inland water resource on Rote Island is a saltwater environment. The extraction of geobiophysical information on inland water resources is needed by studying various aspects of multidisciplinary. The aspects studied are limnology, water quality, conservation of forest resources, geology, geodynamics, water resources, geodesy and geomatics engineering. All geobiophysical information needs to be integrated into an integration system. This is useful for efficiency and effectiveness in the utilization of data and information. This integration system (geovisualization) is in the form of WebGIS and storytelling maps. This integration system is dynamic so it can update its latest spatial information. This integration system can be used to promote Rote island tourism. This integration system can be accessed via the website geopark4rote. com. This integration system can be applied in other regions so reached one map policy and a system for inland water resources will be realized in Indonesia.",

LOD 1 of 3D representations of city buildings are presented into a 2.5D map for pedestrian navigation test. This 3D map display is evaluated against familiar 2D map system on the test participants’ smartphones. 16 participants were involved in the field test. The typical walking model of a searching task that is focused only to look for a certain address of building is chosen as the way finding model during the field test. Three kinds of navigation processes i.e. self-orientation, spatial knowledge acquisition and navigation decision for searching task were evaluated for each test participant. Usability measures of 3D map-based display over 2D-map based display for pedestrian navigation were collected from test participants’ mobile devices. In addition to that, activities of test participants in terms of acceleration and orientation information are used to support analysis of pattern and trends of test participants. As the testing app is also intended to support smart city application, its ability to provide user report on complaints was also assessed. Most participants agreed with the statements in the questionnaire that were organized into three sections, i.e. addressing participants’ interaction, participants’ responses in navigation processes and crowdsensing. The results suggest that 3D map-based pedestrian navigation is more usable to be used to look for a certain address of building in central tourist area of urban city.",

Lidar is often used to produce real-world measurement, resulting in point clouds which further processed into a 3D model. However, this method possesses some limitation, e.g. tedious, expensive works and high technicalities, which limits its usability in a smaller area. Currently, there exists pipeline utilize point-clouds from Lidar data to automate the generation of 3D city model. For example, 3dfier (http://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier) is a software capable of generating LoD 1 3D city model from lidar point cloud data. The resulting CityGML file could further be used in a 3D GIS viewer to produce an interactive 3D city model. This research proposed the use of Structure from Motion (SfM) method to obtain point cloud from UAV data. Using SfM to generate point clouds means cheaper and shorter production time, as well as more suitable for smaller area compared to LiDAR. 3Dfier could be utilized to produce 3D model from the point cloud. Subsequently, a game engine, i.e. Unity 3D, is utilized as the visualization platform. Previous works shows that a game engine could be used as an interactive environment for exploring virtual world based on real-world measurement and other data, such as parcel boundaries. This works shows that the process of generating 3D city model could be achieved using the proposed pipeline.",

However, many other aspects of Rote Island, such as its inland waters, left unexplored and are unknown to tourists or stakeholders. The lack of infrastructure is one of the factors causing underdevelopment in these areas. This paper reports the outcome of an expedition set to uncover the uniqueness of Rote Island’s tourism potential, especially on its inland waters. The expedition involves multidisciplinary researchers from some of Indonesian institutions related to inland waters, such as LAPAN, LIPI, PUPERA, KLHK and KKP to conduct some preliminary research on Rote Island’s saltwater lake. Mobile devices equipped with GIS software were used to obtain data during the survey. Some of the findings including the misleading toponyms found in online sources of the lakes, the biogeophysical condition of the lakes, as well as vegetations and wildlife of the area. The Rote Island Snake-necked Turtle (Chelodina Mccordi) is one of the near-extinct species which habitat needs to be identified and wellpreserved, thus tourism should take into account natural preservation in the lakes and its surroundings. Based on the results we suggest that a Geopark should be initialized in and around Rote Island’s lakes. These findings are presented as a storytelling map, both to attract tourism and to emphasize the geospatial aspects of the lakes. A WebGIS is also developed to integrate data from different institutions to aide decision making. The result is geopark4rote. com, which present the storytelling map and WebGIS to be …",

        "abstract": "The Southeast Asian Haze in 2014 and 2015 is the worst transboundary haze episodes recorded to date. The haze mainly originated from burning of biomass material in peatland area, caused major health problems and economic losses. Peat forest conversion to forest and agriculture industry by utilizing drainage canals is one of main fire drivers that need to be restored, while conflicts on land and livelihood further adding complexity on the issue. Water and peatland management are among the key activities for reducing the peat fire risk and for eliminating the transboundary haze problems. Geospatial data have been collected in peatland areas in Indonesia to support hydrological restoration plans to prevent drying of peat biomasses. Aside from satellite and UAV data, crowdsourcing could also be conducted by engaging residents in collecting spatial data on peat environment while at the same time raising awareness on peatland management and peat fire prevention. This paper elaborates our findings in developing a Geogame App for mitigating haze in peatland area. The study area is situated in Padang Island, Riau, Indonesia. The gamification was implemented as a location-based, augmented reality adventure game. The storyline revolves around peat-related theme, with game elements represent different aspects of peatland management. The game incorporates real-world data as a game element, which also serves as a platform for collecting data around the users. Game mockup and use case scenario are provided to model the spatial data collected through the game for decision makers related to peat fire management.",

        "abstract": "The needs for 3D geospatial data are growing rapidly as indicated by the emergence of new instruments and algorithms for 3D geospatial data acquisition. However, most of currently available instruments for 3D geospatial data acquisition are limited by its operational cost and requirements of technical expertise. An alternative is to utilize image-based modeling algorithm to obtain 3D data with lower operational cost and requirements. Structure from Motion (SfM) is an algorithm to obtain 3D geospatial data capable of producing point-cloud reconstruction and camera parameters from overlapping images. With the advancement of computation and internet technologies, it is possible to develop an accessible online 3D reconstruction services based on SfM algorithm.This thesis addresses the use of open source software to develop a cloud-based SfM reconstruction service, namely CloudSfM. Development of CloudSfM can be categorized into two groups: the first is the development of SfM reconstruction pipelines using open source SfM libraries, and the second is development of the web framework. Open source libraries implementing Global SfM algorithm (ie OpenMVG, MVE, FSSR and MVS-T) were employed in the development of SfM pipelines to produce 3D textured models, while MEAN frameworks, consist of MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS, were used in the development of Single Page Application (SPA) using MVC (Multi-View Controller) model. Vagrant virtualization were used to produce CloudSfM box to serve cloud-based service for SfM reconstruction.",

Vehicle state berguna untuk control otomatis, realtime planning, data logging, Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM), atau komunikasi operator yang dipakai pada navigasi. Navigasi sering digunakan untuk memandu suatu objek, baik manusia, kendaraan maupun robot, untuk melewati suatu daerah yang belum dikenali sebelumnya.Pendekatan klasik pada estimasi vehicle state adalah dengan melengkapi kendaraan dengan sensor inersia yang mampu mengukur percepatan dan kecepatan sudut kendaraan. Dengan kalibrasi dan inisialisasi yang sesuai, integrasi kecepatan sudut menyediakan sebuah estimasi bagi attitude, ketika diintegrasikan dengan percepatan maka akan menyeridkan estimasi kecepatan dan posisi. Lingkungan integrasi pada pendekatan ini memiliki aspek positif dan negative. Pada aspek positif, integrasi akan memperhalus kesalahan frekuensi tinggi (sensor noise). Pada aspek negatifnya, integrasi kesalahan frekuensi rendah karena adanya bias, kesalahan faktor skala, atau ketidaklurusan akan menyebabkan peningkatan kesalahan antara vehicle state terestimasi dan vehicle state sebenarnya. Estimasi vehicle state dihitung dengan integrasi data dari sensor high-rate yang dikoreksi menggunakan pengukuran dari sensor low rate yang sesuai.",

        "abstract": "This study introduces the Misclassification Likelihood Matrix (MLM) as a novel tool for quantifying the reliability of neural network predictions under distribution shifts. The MLM is obtained by leveraging softmax outputs and clustering techniques to measure the distances between the predictions of a trained neural network and class centroids. By analyzing these distances, the MLM provides a comprehensive view of the model's misclassification tendencies, enabling decision-makers to identify the most common and critical sources of errors. The MLM allows for the prioritization of model improvements and the establishment of decision thresholds based on acceptable risk levels. The approach is evaluated on the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a perturbed version of the dataset to simulate distribution shifts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLM in assessing the reliability of predictions and highlight its potential in enhancing the interpretability and risk mitigation capabilities of neural networks. The implications of this work extend beyond image classification, with ongoing applications in autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars, to improve the safety and reliability of decision-making in complex, real-world environments.",

Conceptually, the process of address standardization and geocoding in the context of AUPB is closely related to the orderly administration of government, accountability of government agencies and/or officials, and implementation of statutory provisions. Overall, the element of AUPB that plays the most role in the standardization process and the address geocoding system is the principle of legal certainty. The principle of openness is attached to data security, and both are synchronized in implementing standardization and geocoding systems for urban and rural addresses in Indonesia. Even though all columns in the address database are stored in Elasticsearch, only specific columns can be accessed by general users through the Geocoding System website. Hence, the addresses presented are general data and do not contain personal data.",

        "abstract": "Topography is the basic geospatial information that is used as the main reference in the extraction of thematic geospatial information. It consists of terrestrial topography (topography) and underwater topography (bathymetry). One of the problems related to topography is the availability of detailed and up-to-date topographic and bathymetry data. This research proposes the latest bathymetry and topography extraction modeling with multi-source geospatial data including PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, Landsat images, and in-situ field data. The study area is located in Lake Ledulu, Rote Island, Indonesia. Bathymetry and topography were extracted using PlanetScope imagery and in-situ field data using the least squares adjustment computation approach. The mathematical design model uses the latest DTM method, which correlated with in-situ data. Time-series Landsat and PlanetScope are used to extract the lake bank boundaries with water using the harmonic method. DEM integration method is used to integrate bathymetry and topography. The updated topography and bathymetry are performed by adding the true vertical deformation extracted from Sentinel-1 imagery using the D-InSAR method. The results obtained are the latest bathymetry and topography of Lake Ledulu in 2022 or so-called DTM (2022). Then DTM (2022) is tested for profile checking and vertical accuracy at the confidence level of 95% according to the ASPRS 2014. The DTM (2022) of Lake Ledulu has a vertical accuracy of+ 61.54 cm or according to 1: 5000–1: 10000 scale mapping.

Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) provides a structured framework for evaluating multiple criteria but often fails to capture the nuanced preferences of decision-makers. Geovisualisation tools can help understand data, but representing intricate relationships within MCDA models, especially with multivariate data, remains difficult. This study proposes a solution by combining MCDA and geovisualisation strengths using gridded-glyphmaps. This approach enables interactive exploration of multivariate geospatial data, allowing decision-makers to adjust parameter weights in real-time and dynamically assess decision alternatives. We demonstrate this approach's effectiveness through decarbonisation planning scenarios in Cambridge, UK. Our glyphs represent multiple variables' interplay, allowing for flexible criteria weight refinement. Discretising the data into grids reveals patterns and relationships missed by traditional representations like choropleth maps. Our approach demonstrates how gridded-glyphmap visualisation within an MCDA model fosters insights and transparency in decarbonisation planning scenarios.",

The results can be used to update the existing themes in the RBI Map. This study takes the case of the Sleman district in the province of Yogyakarta area which is developing quite rapidly. The Sentinel-2 level 2A data from 2 epochs was used for sharpening. The process of sharpening is …",

This regency has varieties of unique and endemic geology, biodiversity and inland waters. The regency has some 80 lakes where around 20 are saltwater lakes. The salinity of these lakes exceeds the salinity of seawater. The majority of these saltwater lakes are located in the Dead Sea Lake Region of Rote islands. Geologically, the islands have mixed deformations that move vertically and horizontally and are lifted partially from the Australian continent. The biodiversity in this region is also unique as there is a Roti snake-necked turtle that enters endangered animals. There are also unique mangroves conditions that live far from water sources due to vertical deformation. Rote Ndao also has areas of peat coal that are mixed with saltwater areas, freshwater areas, and brackish water areas. Remote sensing can be …",

        "abstract": "Abstract Local Area Energy Plans (LAEPs) are designed to provide holistic, coherent paths towards achieving net-zero emissions for local areas in the United Kingdom. They are meant to integrate a broad range of technical, social, and economic interventions (eg, deployment of renewable technologies, reduction of fuel poverty, upgrades in the infrastructure of energy transport) over an extended time frame. Such plans are complex and understanding how they unfold across space and over time is difficult. Traditional geo-spatial visualisation methods, such as layered choropleth maps, face limitations in effectively conveying multifaceted data, especially when it varies over time. We instead explore gridded-glyphmaps to understand the effective ways of visualising multivariate spatio-temporal data in the context of understanding energy decarbonisation planning. We show how we can depict decarbonisation outcomes and costs for different types of interventions across different areas as small time-series glyphs. We designed and validated our approaches through iterative contextual interviews with stakeholders in the energy domain.",

Toponimi atau ilmu yang membahas penamaan suatu unsur topografi merupakan salah satu aspek penting dalam penyajian peta. Keseluruhan nama unsur topografi suatu wilayah disebut dengan gasetir. Basisdata gasetir yang memuat nama unsur suatu objek topografi pada suatu wilayah diantaranya dikumpulkan melalui sebuah platform bernama Geonames. Dalam hal ini, Geonames menyusun basisdata dari sebelas juta nama unsur topografis di seluru dunia, yang seluruhnya dapat diakses dari www. geonames. org. Geonames juga menyediakan layanan pencarian (webservice API) yang dapat digunakan pada berbagai peta online.Analisis terhadap data toponimi dapat memberikan berbagai informasi yang berharga, diantaranya adalah persebaran bahasa daerah di berbagai wilayah di Indonesia. Diantara analisis yang dapat digunakan adalah melalui metode analitis visual berbasis spasial (spatial visual analytics). Metode analitis visual dapat digunakan untuk menyajikan informasi dalam bentuk visualisasi interaktif dimana pengguna akan mendapatkan gambaran lebih jauh mengenai data yang ditampilkan dibandingkan dengan menggunakan gambaran peta statis. Dalam penelitian ini, sejumlah lebih dari 300.000 basisdata gasetir dari Geonames di wilayah Indonesia akan digunakan sebagai bahan penyusunan antarmuka interaktif dengan menggunakan metode analitis visual dalam bentuk heatmap.
